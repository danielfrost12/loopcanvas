# Overview

The Music Visuals API generates **Spotify-style 7-second Canvases** and **full-length music videos** from audio.

## How it works

```
Audio → Analysis → Template → Render → Export
```

1. **Upload audio** — Create a Track with your audio file
2. **Analysis** — We extract BPM, sections, energy, and structure
3. **Template** — Apply a visual style (or use defaults)
4. **Render** — Generate video asynchronously
5. **Export** — Download in multiple formats and aspect ratios
